<b>Problems Faced</b>

Figuring out how to link the data provided in the response to required elements so that they are displayed properly. I tried to use Google maps autocomplete feature so while 
the user is typing suggestions are provided which help the user. But I couldn't make it work.

<b>Scope of Improvement</b>

Currently the website only gives weather information only if the user types the correct spelling of the location, it doesn't inform the user if he/she commits a mistake while
typing the location. So informing the user that the typed location is not correct or there is a spelling mistake so that he/she can correct the mistake. Or to eradicate this 
error by adding autocomplete feature so that the user gets a correct response everytime. Styling the website so that it is more responsive and good looking. 
Customizing the website according to the weather.
